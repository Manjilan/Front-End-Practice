# Form Validation
Build a simple sign up form, which collects a userâ€™s:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address
- Password
- Password confirmation
Validate the form to allow submission. The validations should include common considerations, such as:

- No missing fields
- Valid email address
- String password
- Matching password
And any other validation you think is needed.
